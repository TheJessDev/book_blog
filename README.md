# book_blog

This project runs on Django framework. 

This is a blog site for book reviews. Users can create a personal account and begin posting reviews to the main page. Users that have logged into the site
have the options to create, edit or delete posts. They will also have access to their own personal user profile. User profiles can also be edited by the user to include 
a user photo, bio, update personal information or change their passwords. 
Users that are not logged in will only have access to the Main page.
The main page contains a nav bar with links to guide the user to the features available. Also located in the nav bar is a search box to filter posts by book title, book author
or other site users. 
All posts published are displayed in cards on the main page with the option to 'read more' (and edit if user is logged in). The read more link will display all info 
related to the post selected. Logged in users have the option to filter the post list to display only their own reviews to edit or delete with ease.
